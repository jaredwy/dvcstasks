	<h1>Working Directory</h1>
	
    <p>Bamboo looks for the build files in the build's working directory.  You can specify the working directory to be the build's root directory or one of it's sub directories.

    <h2>Using the Build Root Directory</h2>

    <p>Bamboo assumes that the build root directory is the working directory. If this is the case for your build, simply leave the <i>Working Sub Directory:</i> blank:</p>

    <h2>Using a Build's Sub-Directory</h2>

    <p>If your build has a build script in a subdirectory that is meant to be run from within that directory, you can specify subdirectory in the <i>Working Sub Directory:</i> field:</p>
